Web-Based File Manager Prototype in PHP

Approach and Design Decisions:

1. User Registration and Login:

   - I implemented a user registration and login system to distinguish file owners. Users are required to register with a unique username and password.
   - Passwords are securely hashed and stored in the database to enhance security.
   - Sessions are used to manage user authentication throughout the application.

2. File Upload:

   - Created a file upload form that allows registered users to upload files.
   - Implemented file size and MIME type validation to ensure uploads meet specified criteria.
   - Generated unique filenames for uploaded files based on the current timestamp and a UUID.
   - Organized uploaded files into user-specific directories and MIME type directories for better organization.

3. File Listing:

   - Developed a page for users to view their uploaded files.
   - Displayed file names, upload timestamps, file sizes, file types, and the uploader's username in a table format.
   - Provided a "Download" link for each file, allowing users to download their uploaded files.

4. File Download:

   - Implemented a file download mechanism that sends files to users upon request.
   - Set appropriate HTTP headers for content disposition, content type, and content length to trigger file downloads.
   - Verified user access rights to downloaded files by checking the uploader's username.

5. Security:

   - Employed security measures to prevent unauthorized access to files and directories.
   - Protected against common security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, by using prepared statements and secure database handling.

6. User-Friendly Interface:

   - Created an intuitive and user-friendly interface for file uploads, viewing, and downloading.
   - Implemented error handling to provide informative feedback to users when necessary.

Challenges Encountered:

1. Database Configuration:

   - Setting up and configuring the SQLite database required careful attention to ensure proper functionality.

2. File Management:

   - Organizing and managing uploaded files in a structured way, including handling unique filenames and directory structure, was a complex task.

3. Error Handling:

   - Implementing comprehensive error handling to provide meaningful feedback to users and log errors for debugging was essential but challenging.

4. Security Considerations:

   - Ensuring the security of user data and files, including preventing unauthorized access and protecting against common web security threats, was a top priority.

Conclusion:

The web-based file manager prototype in PHP successfully provides users with the ability to register, upload, view, and download files in a secure and user-friendly manner. Careful attention to security, database management, and error handling contributed to the robustness of the application. Further development could include additional features, such as file sharing and folder organization, to enhance its capabilities.
